	<b>Q:</b>Why read this? <b>A:</b> It's quicker than reading a Wikipedia article, but covers only the important stuff in a less verbose manner. From here you will be fit to have a simple discussion on our discord server, so that you can learn more about what you care about. This is just an overview.<br><br><br>
	Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is the process of learning another language. It is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_linguistics" target="_blank">Applied Linguistics</a>, and is very related to psychology. Here's two exampless that may show you what this is about:
	<br><br>
	1. Age is not as important as people think. There is a theory called The Critical Period Hypothesis. This is Highly debated but, if true, only means that you can not fully achieve fluency (<b>Note:</b> Fluency is defined as native-like.), which is not a problem. You will see that age is an important factor in SLA.
	<br><br>
	2. The silent period, preproduction. While some people will tell you that you should start speaking from the start, there is naturally a stage in which people do not make sentences. This stage ranges from 0-500 words in your vocabulary. Some people do not have this stage. In education, many times the "silent period" is skipped so that evaluation can be started immediately.

	<br><br><b>The Interlanguage:</b><br>
	The best way of explaining this is explaining what it explains. A study (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120110125249/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm">Souce</a>) shows that Serbo-Croat natives would say "What does Pat doing now?", but that is not gramatically correct in either language. The Interlanguage is a system of language processing that develops as you learn a language (nurture), rather than Serbo-Croat speakers applying their own grammar, they used the interlanguage as a "middleman", which is a language itself. The processes that create the interlanguage:<br>
	1. Language transfer: Basically translation. Using the mother tongue to speak in the other language.<br>
	2. Overgeneralizing rules: I doed. I sticked. (Common in language learners and children)<br>
	3. Simplifying the language.<br>
	<br><b>Order of acquisition:</b><br>
	There's strong similarities between every learners order in which they grasp grammatical concepts, despite things like teacher intervention. For the German learners reading this, there has been studies showing that students start with the word order of their own language, and don't adopt German's word order early.
	<br><br><b>Input:</b><br>
	You may have seen stuff from Fluent in 3 Months or your university about the greatness of comprehensible input. Steven Krashen took a very strong stance that this was true. Input is extremely important, but more modern studies have shown that this is not as important as Krashen thought. For examples, even after many years in a french-canadian immersion program, learners fell behind in grammar. [Start of opinion]: Of course, you don't need great grammar. You could say "Me want bathroom" and it would be fine, along with "What does Pat doing now?". Input is very important. Read a lot. Watch kids shows. Watch movies you've seen a lot and write down new words (Speaking from experience. For example: I just watched Infinity War in Italian, and I learned probably 200 words that are now in my active vocab; most were cognates). Learning from Word lists and grammar books is boring and doesn't work as well. [End of opinion]<br>
	<br><b>Attrition:</b><br>
	Attrition is just loss of capability in the target language from lack of exposure. The regression hypothesis proposes that attrition occurs in the opposite of acquisition. Younger children tend to have attrition occur faster. The worse you are, the faster your attrition occurs. For proficient speakers, for longer periods of time, no attrition is observable.<br><br>
